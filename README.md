# Web Development Project 4 - *Vini Vici-Dog Edition*

Submitted by: **Neel Mokaria**

This web app: **Allows users to discover random dog breeds, view information about the breed, and ban breeds from future searches. Users can dynamically adjust the number of images retrieved and the order in which they are displayed. The app also keeps track of previously viewed dogs and prevents banned breeds from being shown again.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [X] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [X] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session
